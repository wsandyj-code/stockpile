# CLAUDE.md — options-scanner

## Purpose

Scan an option chain and rank each option by IV excess — how far its
implied volatility sits above or below a fitted 2-D surface — to
surface IV-rich candidates for covered calls, cash-secured puts, and
roll setups (or IV-cheap candidates in buy mode).

The output is a **screening heuristic, not a mispricing or arbitrage
claim**. Vol smiles and skew are legitimate, the no-arbitrage
principle does not require the surface to be smooth, and IV+pp
deviations can reflect demand pressure, event risk, or stale prints
as easily as a tradeable signal. Phrase user-facing copy accordingly
— "mispriced", "overpriced", "underpriced", "anomaly" are out;
"IV-rich", "IV-cheap", "outlier", "stands above/below the surface"
are in. "Rich premium" / "cheap premium" are conventional trader
vernacular and remain fine.

## How it works

1. Fetch all expirations with DTE >= min_dte from Yahoo Finance
2. Build a 2-D IV surface: IV ≈ f(log-moneyness, √T)
3. Compute IV excess = actual IV − fitted IV (positive = IV-rich,
   sits above the fitted surface)
4. Annotate each option with earnings events within its expiration
   window (elevated IV around earnings is expected, not a signal)
5. Display ranked table including delta, annualized yield, and OI

## Running the tool

Always run from the **repo root** using `uv run`:

```bash
# Both calls and puts (default)
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AAPL

# Covered call selection only
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AAPL --calls

# Cash-secured put selection only
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AAPL --puts

# Roll an existing short call
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AAPL --roll \
    --type call --strike 185 --expiration 2026-01-16

# Adjust filters
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AAPL --calls \
    --min-dte 400 --min-oi 50 --top 20
```

Never use `python` directly — dependencies won't be resolved.
Run `uv sync` from repo root after any `pyproject.toml` change.

## LT capital gains note

Selling an option and holding the short position for 366+ days
qualifies the premium for long-term capital gains rates. The tool
prints the earliest qualifying close date for a position opened today.

## YouTube production materials (sibling private repo)

Scripts, slide HTML, and image assets for the YouTube tutorials
about this tool live in a separate private repo at
`../stockpile-private/options-scanner/youtube/` (sibling directory
to this one). They are active working material and Claude should
treat them as in-scope when asked.

Layout: one subfolder per episode, under
`../stockpile-private/options-scanner/youtube/`.

- `ep1/` — first episode: full tool walkthrough. Script at
  `ep1/script.md`, slide HTMLs (`*-slide.html`), and `ep1/images/`
  with thumbnails and screenshots.
- `ep2/` — second episode in active drafting. Focused on the
  Schwab data source plus features added since ep1 (GEX chart,
  index tickers, stockpile CSV, polish). Script at `ep2/script.md`.
- Future episodes follow the same `epN/` pattern.

When the user asks about "the script", "the episode", or "the
YouTube video" without naming one, assume the most recent episode
folder. Read the existing script before making edits — episodes
follow a consistent template (slide cues in `[NN ...]`, on-camera
directions in parens, content blocks separated by `---`).
