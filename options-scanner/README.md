# options-scanner

Scans a LEAPS option chain (1 year+ out) to find overpriced options
worth selling: covered calls, cash-secured puts, and roll candidates.
Ranked by how much each option's implied volatility sits above a
fitted volatility surface — the higher the excess, the richer the
premium relative to the rest of the chain.

Three entry points:

- **Web UI** — browser-based, no CLI knowledge required. Recommended.
- **CLI scanner** — single ticker, scriptable.
- **Portfolio scanner** — reads a brokerage CSV and scans every open
  position.

Data is sourced from **Yahoo Finance** (default, no setup) or the
**Schwab developer API** (real-time quotes and actual Greeks). See
[SCHWAB_DATA_SOURCE.md](SCHWAB_DATA_SOURCE.md) to enable Schwab.

For repo-wide setup (`uv sync`, etc.) see the
[root README](../README.md#setup).

## Web UI

```bash
uv run streamlit run options-scanner/run_app.py
```

A browser tab opens at `http://localhost:8501` with two tabs:

- **Single Ticker** — type a symbol, pick Calls/Puts/Both and Sell/Buy,
  hit Scan. You get a volatility-surface chart with top picks
  highlighted, a per-expiration chain view sorted by strike with
  IV+pp row shading, and a top candidates table ranked across all
  expirations.
- **Portfolio** — drag in a brokerage CSV (Schwab, Robinhood, Fidelity,
  Merrill, or a hand-written
  [stockpile file](../docs/stockpile-format.md)), pick the format, hit
  Scan Portfolio. Each position gets its own chart and table in a
  collapsible section. The validator runs automatically on upload and
  shows any problems before you scan.

Both tabs offer a Download HTML Report button.

### What's actually running at localhost:8501

`streamlit run` starts a local **Uvicorn** web server. The browser
loads the page over HTTP, then opens a persistent **WebSocket** that
streams widget changes back to Python; every interaction re-runs
`run_app.py` top-to-bottom and pushes the new output to the page.

By default Streamlit binds to `0.0.0.0`, so the app is reachable from
other machines on your network at the "Network URL" Streamlit prints
(e.g. `http://10.0.0.5:8501`). For solo home use that's harmless. On a
shared/public network, pass `--server.address 127.0.0.1` to bind only
to localhost.

To stop the server: `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where you started it.
There is no in-app shutdown button.

### Common problems

**`Port 8501 is already in use` (or app appears on `:8502`)**
A previous Streamlit is still running. Stop it with `Ctrl+C` in its
terminal, or pass `--server.port 9000` to use a different port.

**Browser doesn't open automatically**
Happens on some Windows setups and over SSH. Just paste the URL the
terminal printed. Pass `--server.headless true` to suppress the
auto-open attempt.

**Windows Firewall prompt the first time**
Allow on Private networks; deny Public.

**First scan takes 5–15 seconds**
Normal — fetching the chain from Yahoo Finance, fitting the surface,
looking up earnings. There's a spinner.

**Empty chart on a ticker that worked moments ago**
Yahoo throttling. The 5-minute cache mitigates repeated scans of the
same ticker; otherwise wait it out.

**Edited `run_app.py` and the chart still looks wrong**
Streamlit auto-reloads code, but `@st.cache_data` results survive
across reruns. Open the hamburger menu (top-right) → **Clear cache** →
rerun.

**`ModuleNotFoundError` after a `git pull`**
Dependencies changed. Run `uv sync` from the repo root.

## Portfolio scanner (CLI)

```bash
uv run options-scanner/run_portfolio.py --csv input/schwab028.csv
uv run options-scanner/run_portfolio.py --csv input/schwab028.csv \
    --html --tickers AAPL AMD
```

Reads the CSV, finds every open stock position, and runs a sell scan
on each. Positions with an existing covered call get a roll scan
showing the `NetCr` column instead. Add `--html` for one combined
report covering the whole account.

## CLI scanner

Always run from the **repo root** using `uv run`:

```bash
# Covered call selection
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AMD --calls

# Cash-secured put selection
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AMD --puts

# Both calls and puts
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AMD

# Narrow to a delta range (e.g. 0.20–0.45 sweet spot)
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AMD --calls \
    --min-delta 0.20 --max-delta 0.45

# Roll an existing short call
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AMD --roll \
    --type call --strike 600 --expiration 2026-01-16
```

### All options

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--calls` / `--puts` | both | Show only calls or only puts |
| `--buy` | off | Buy mode: rank by lowest IV (underpriced) |
| `--min-dte` | 365 | Minimum days to expiration |
| `--max-dte` | none | Maximum days to expiration |
| `--min-oi` | 25 | Minimum open interest |
| `--min-delta` | 0.10 | Exclude abs(delta) below this |
| `--max-delta` | 0.75 | Exclude abs(delta) above this |
| `--top` | 10 | Max rows shown in terminal |
| `--html` | off | Save an HTML report (see below) |
| `--output-dir` | `options-scanner/output/` | Directory for HTML files |
| `--roll` | — | Roll mode (requires `--type`, `--strike`, `--expiration`) |
| `--data-source` | from config | `yahoo` or `schwab` — overrides config.toml |

### HTML report

Add `--html` to save a self-contained HTML file alongside the
terminal output:

```bash
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AMD --calls --html
```

The file is written to `options-scanner/output/` by default, named
`{TICKER}_{type}_{action}_{date}.html` (e.g.
`AMD_call_sell_20260505.html`). Open it in any browser — columns are
sortable by clicking the headers, and the IV+pp column is
color-coded (green = attractive / overpriced to sell; red =
unattractive / underpriced to buy).

Override the directory with `--output-dir path/to/dir`.

## Output columns

| Column | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| Strike | Option strike price |
| Expiration | Expiration date |
| DTE | Days to expiration |
| Bid / Ask / Mid | Market prices |
| IV% | Implied volatility (annualized) |
| IV+pp | IV excess above the fitted surface (see below) |
| Delta | Approx. probability of expiring in the money |
| Ann% | Annualized yield on premium (calls vs. spot; puts vs. strike) |
| OI | Open interest |
| NetCr | Roll mode only: new mid minus close cost |

```

### Is there a genuine anomaly?

Look at the `IV+pp` column first. If the top value is under ~3pp, the
chain is uniformly priced and the ranking is mostly noise — there is
no standout overpriced option. In the AMD example above, the max is
+1.6pp, which is small. All these options are priced fairly relative
to each other; AMD's volatility surface is smooth right now.

When you see IV+pp of 5pp or more on a specific strike, that option
is genuinely expensive versus its neighbors — a meaningful signal.

### Picking a strike

When IV+pp is flat across the chain (as above), the decision comes
down to your own risk tolerance:

**Lower delta (e.g. $700, delta 0.29):**
- ~29% chance of assignment at expiration
- Collects $28.38 per share (~7% annualized)
- More room for the stock to run before you're called away

**Higher delta (e.g. $530, delta 0.44):**
- ~44% chance of assignment — roughly a coin flip
- Collects $50.52 per share (~12.7% annualized)
- Much better premium, but real risk of losing the shares

A common covered call sweet spot is delta 0.25–0.40, which balances
premium against assignment risk. Use `--delta-min 0.25 --delta-max
0.40` to filter to that range.

### Earnings tag

`1E` next to an expiration means one earnings event falls before that
date. Elevated IV near earnings is expected and is not a free lunch —
the market is pricing in the uncertainty of the announcement. Selling
into earnings IV is a strategy in itself, but goes beyond anomaly
detection.

### LT capital gains

The header shows the earliest date you could close to qualify for
long-term capital gains treatment (open date + 366 days). If you sell
today and close after that date, the premium is taxed at the LT rate.
In the example: sell today, close any time after **May 06 '27**.

### Ann% for puts

For puts, `Ann%` is calculated as premium divided by the **strike
price** (the capital you'd need to buy 100 shares if assigned),
annualized. This gives the true return on capital at risk.

## Gamma Exposure (GEX)

The web UI single-ticker tab shows a **GEX bar chart** below the
volatility surface chart. It is not available in the CLI.

### What it is

GEX measures the aggregate gamma that market makers (dealers) hold
across every strike in the chain. Because dealers typically sell
options to retail buyers, they end up short gamma. To stay delta-
neutral they must hedge:

- **Short gamma (negative GEX):** dealers buy stock as price rises
  and sell as it falls — amplifying moves in both directions.
- **Long gamma (positive GEX):** dealers sell into rallies and buy
  dips — dampening moves and pinning price near high-OI strikes.

### How to read the chart

The chart shows net GEX per strike as green (positive / pinning) or
red (negative / amplifying) bars. The dashed vertical line is the
current spot price.

Three summary metrics appear above the chart:

| Metric | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Total GEX** | Sum across all strikes. Positive = pinning regime; negative = amplifying regime. |
| **Regime** | Plain-English label for the current total GEX sign. |
| **Zero-gamma level** | The strike where cumulative dealer gamma flips from positive to negative. Price above this level tends to behave more volatilely. |

### What it tells a covered call seller

A large **green wall above your strike** means dealers are long gamma
there — their hedging activity tends to cap the stock near that
level. That is tailwind for a covered call: the stock is less likely
to blow through your strike.

A **red zone above your strike** means the opposite — if the stock
enters that range, dealer hedging amplifies the move and your call
is more likely to get tested.

### Caveats

**LEAPS chains are thin.** GEX is most reliable on heavily traded
near-term options (0–60 DTE) where OI is large and IVs are fresh.
LEAPS have lower OI and wider bid/ask spreads, so treat the chart
as directional context rather than a precise signal.

**Yahoo Finance data quality.** When using Yahoo Finance, gamma is
estimated via Black-Scholes from Yahoo's IV, which can be hours or
days old on LEAPS strikes. GEX computed from stale IV is a rougher
approximation. The Schwab data source provides real-time gamma
values from Schwab's own model, which are more reliable.

**Dealer positioning is an assumption.** The standard GEX model
assumes dealers are net short calls and net long puts. This is
generally true in aggregate but not always correct for every strike
or every ticker.

## Roll mode example

```bash
uv run options-scanner/run_scanner.py AMD --roll \
    --type call --strike 600 --expiration 2026-01-16
```

Adds a `NetCr` column showing what you'd receive net after buying
back the existing position. Positive = net credit roll. The table
shows only calls (same type as the position being rolled), ranked
by IV excess so the richest new premium surfaces first.

## Data sources

The tool supports two data sources, selectable via `config.toml`,
the `--data-source` CLI flag, or the sidebar dropdown in the web UI:

| Source | Setup | Data quality |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Yahoo Finance** (default) | None — works out of the box | Delayed IV, no live Greeks |
| **Schwab** | Free Schwab developer account; see [SCHWAB_DATA_SOURCE.md](SCHWAB_DATA_SOURCE.md) | Real-time quotes, actual Greeks |

When using Schwab, delta comes directly from Schwab's model rather
than being estimated via Black-Scholes from stale IV. Earnings dates
still come from Yahoo Finance — the Schwab API does not provide them.

Before relying on Yahoo Finance output, it's worth understanding
where that data falls short.

### Yahoo Finance limitations

**Stale implied volatility.** Yahoo returns the IV from the last
option trade, not a live market-maker quote. On thinly traded
strikes — common on LEAPS, deep OTM, and low-volume tickers —
that trade may have happened hours or days ago. Stale IV
distorts the surface fit, produces false IV+pp signals, and
makes the Black-Scholes delta unreliable. A lone dot sitting
far from its neighbors with no obvious reason is almost always
a stale quote, not a real signal.

**No live bid/ask.** The bid and ask returned are from the last
market refresh, not a live feed. For actively traded near-term
options this is usually fine; for LEAPS it can be meaningfully
wrong. Always check the live spread on your broker before
placing a trade.

**Greeks not provided.** Yahoo does not return delta, gamma,
theta, or vega. Delta is computed from Black-Scholes using
Yahoo's IV — so if the IV is stale, the delta is too.

**Rate limiting.** Yahoo's unofficial API is unauthenticated and
subject to throttling. Repeated rapid scans can return empty
results. The scanner caches results for 5 minutes to mitigate
this.

**Expiration coverage.** Yahoo may not return the full list of
expirations available at your broker. Some far-dated LEAPS
expirations can be missing entirely.

**Earnings dates.** Yahoo's earnings calendar is sometimes
missing, off by a day, or not yet populated for upcoming
quarters.

### Alternative data sources

These limitations are known, and one or more of the sources
below will likely be added to the tool soon — better data
support is on the roadmap and will be a drop-in improvement
when it lands. In the meantime, the sources below are options
if you want to explore plugging one in yourself:

### Free with a brokerage account

| Source | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Schwab** (`schwab-py`) | Real-time, full Greeks, clean REST API. Free for any Schwab account holder. Largest overlap with covered-call sellers. |
| **Tradier** | Very clean REST/JSON API, excellent docs, free developer sandbox with delayed data, real-time with a funded account. Most developer-friendly broker API available. |
| **Tastytrade** | Official API, free for account holders. Options-focused, good Greeks. Popular with the theta-gang crowd. |
| **Interactive Brokers** | Free for account holders via TWS API or newer REST API. Most comprehensive data, but requires their desktop app running as a gateway (`ib_insync` library). |
| **E\*TRADE** | Official OAuth-based API, free for account holders, decent option chain data with Greeks. |

### Free without an account (limited)

| Source | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Alpha Vantage** | Free API key, 25 requests/day on free tier. Option chains with some Greeks — workable for single-ticker use, too slow for portfolio scans. |
| **Polygon.io** | Free tier gives 15-minute delayed data; real-time ~$29/mo. Clean API, strong Python SDK, popular in the algo/quant community. |
| **Market Data App** | Free tier with options snapshots. Less well-known but solid. |

### Paid

| Source | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Polygon.io** | ~$29/mo for real-time. Most popular among independent developers. |
| **EODHD** | ~$20–50/mo, global coverage, options chains with Greeks. |
| **Intrinio** | Mid-tier pricing, solid quality, good Python SDK. |
| **CBOE LiveVol** | Professional grade, expensive — overkill for this use case. |

### Practical recommendation

**Schwab** (`schwab-py`) is now supported — see
[SCHWAB_DATA_SOURCE.md](SCHWAB_DATA_SOURCE.md) to enable it.
**Tradier** is the easiest next step for a second alternative — the
free developer sandbox lets you test without an active account, and
the REST/JSON responses map cleanly onto how `src/chain.py` fetches
data.

## Roadmap

Planned improvements, roughly in priority order:

- **GEX (Gamma Exposure)** — implemented in the web UI single-ticker
  tab. See the [Gamma Exposure section](#gamma-exposure-gex) above
  for full documentation.
