- **[google-sheets-setup](google-sheets-setup/README.md)** — Google
  Sheets API setup docs.
- **shared** — pip-installable `stocks-shared` package: CSV parsers
  (Schwab, Robinhood, Fidelity, Merrill Edge, and the
  [stockpile manual format](docs/stockpile-format.md)), Yahoo Finance
  and Schwab live API helpers, FIFO analysis, Black-Scholes pricing.

## Quick start

The fastest way to see something useful after cloning is the options
scanner web UI — no CLI knowledge required:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medloh/stockpile.git
cd stockpile
uv sync
uv run streamlit run options-scanner/run_app.py
```

A browser tab opens at http://localhost:8501. Type a ticker on the
**Single Ticker** tab and hit Scan, or drag a brokerage CSV onto the
**Portfolio** tab.

For setup details, brokerage CSV configuration, and tool-specific
commands, see each tool's README linked above.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — install once with:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

`uv sync` creates a single shared `.venv/` for all sub-projects and
installs everything. `uv run` activates it automatically — no manual
`activate` needed.

## Using Claude Code with this repo

All of the tools in this repo were built with a Claude Code
subscription. Clone the repo, open Claude Code in the project
directory, and ask it to help you configure and run any tool with
your own brokerage export.

### Project slash commands

Inside a Claude Code session, type `/` to see project commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/scan TICKER [flags]` | Run the options-scanner CLI for one ticker |
| `/scan-portfolio --csv FILE` | Scan every open position in a brokerage CSV |
| `/scan-ui` | Launch the options scanner web UI |
| `/charts [--symbol X]` | Generate cost-basis charts |
| `/positions` | Run the Google Sheets position tracker |

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing base`

This is Windows blocking pandas' C extension DLLs due to an
Application Control policy. Run from an **administrator PowerShell**:

1. Right-click PowerShell → **Run as administrator**
2. `cd path\to\stockpile`
3. Run the tool normally with `uv run ...`
